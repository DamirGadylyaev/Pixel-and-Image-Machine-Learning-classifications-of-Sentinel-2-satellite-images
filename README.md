# Pixel-and-Image-Machine-Learning-classifications-of-Sentinel-2-satellite-images

This project was created as a final project for the subject of "Advanced Topics of Data Analysis and Programming" during my master's at Potsdam University.

Several different Machine Learning techniques were used to perform Pixel and Image classification methods.
Image classification method has been done using Eurosat RGB dataset.
