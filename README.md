# Pixel-and-Image-Machine-Learning-classifications-of-Sentinel-2-satellite-images

This project was created as a final project during my master's studying at Potsdam University for the subject of "Advanced Topics of Data Analysis and Programming".

Several different Machine Learning techniques were used to perform Pixel and Image classification methods.
Image classification method was done using Eurosat RGB dataset.
